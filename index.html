        Hello everyone and welcome to my resume website! I am currently learning web design at Lambda School
        and am on my way to becoming a web developer someday. I currently have a four year career in banking with four
        years and a bachelors of science in business marketing. As I progress on my way to become a web developer, I
        will update this website more with content to reflect what I am learning. As for now, I hope you enjoy the journey
        and if you want to reach out to me at all, feel free to reach out to me.

      <h5 class="style-border style-border-last">Muptiple Front End Course Graduate / Self Study</h5>
      <h6>October 2017 - March 2019</h6>
      <p>
        Completed various training oline, the main two being udemy.com and frontendmasters.com. I've taken courses as well through
        freecodecamp.com, teamtreehouse.com, and really anything I could get my hands on to teach me about font end development.
        I loved all of the websites in their own way, but the one I spent the most time with was udemy.com due to the fact that
        it wasn't subscription-based and I can still visit the courses I completed to get a refresher.
      </p>
      <h5>Lambda School Student</h5>
      <h6>March 2019 - Present</h6>
      <p>
        Currently about a month into Lambda School and learning a lot more than I ever did by being self-taught. Currently we
        are going over advanced CSS features, and this website is one of the tasks to show for it. Specifically, the preprocessor,
        "Less", is what will be embedded within the CSS on this page. I am very excited to be a student here and I can't wait to
        become a graduate.
